# Farmers Marketplace Backend System

## Product Description

### Overview

The Farmers Marketplace Backend System is designed to power a marketplace platform where verified farmers can list agricultural products, and customers can browse, purchase, and receive products directly from farmers. The backend system provides robust authentication, product management, order fulfillment, and notification services to ensure smooth and secure interactions among farmers, customers, and administrators. This backend also supports the admin team's oversight in ensuring quality and compliance within the marketplace, maintaining a high standard of service and trust.

#### Key Features

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Secure registration** and login for all users (farmers, admin, and customers), using role-based access control to restrict actions based on user roles.
   - **Verification layers** ensure that only verified users have access to sensitive or privileged operations.
   - **Token-based sessions** for secure and scalable access management.

2. **Farmer Registration and Verification**
   - Farmers can register and upload verification documents (e.g., business licenses, farm registrations) to ensure compliance and build credibility.
   - Admins can review and approve or reject farmer profiles, verifying their legitimacy before granting product listing access.
   - **Notification system** keeps farmers updated on the status of their account verification.

3. **Product Management**
   - **Comprehensive CRUD APIs** allow farmers to create, read, update, and delete product listings with details such as name, description, price, quantity, and harvest date.
   - Product images undergo **automatic validation checks** for quality, including resolution and clarity, ensuring professional standards.
   - Products are submitted for admin review, where theyâ€™re checked for compliance, quality, and authenticity before being listed in the marketplace.

4. **Product Display and Search for Customers**
   - Approved products are displayed in the marketplace, accessible through a customer-friendly interface.
   - **Search and filter capabilities** allow customers to browse products based on criteria such as price, rating, and origin.
   - APIs provide customers with product details, including images, descriptions, stock availability, and farmer ratings, creating a transparent buying experience.

5. **Order Management and Checkout**
   - A streamlined **cart and checkout process** allows customers to select products, adjust quantities, and proceed with payments.
   - Backend processes handle real-time inventory checks and confirm product availability before order placement, preventing over-selling.
   - **Order tracking** provides farmers and customers with order status updates from confirmation through to delivery.

6. **Order Fulfillment and Notification System**
   - A notification system ensures that farmers are immediately alerted when new orders are placed, allowing them to prepare products for delivery.
   - **Order status tracking** allows the admin to monitor the fulfillment process, ensuring timely delivery and quality maintenance.
   - Each order update (e.g., order placed, preparing, dispatched) triggers notifications for all relevant parties.

7. **Feedback and Review System**
   - After delivery, customers can provide feedback on product quality, which is displayed as ratings for each product.
   - Negative feedback is flagged and alerts the admin to review potential issues, maintaining marketplace quality.
   - Customer reviews build transparency and assist future buyers in making informed decisions.

8. **Inventory Management**
   - Farmers can monitor stock levels in real-time, ensuring accurate product availability.
   - The system automatically adjusts inventory after each sale, and low-stock alerts notify farmers to replenish products, avoiding stock-outs.

9. **Reports and Analytics**
   - **Dashboard analytics** give administrators insights into marketplace performance, tracking product trends, customer satisfaction, and sales volumes.
   - Visualized data allows admins to monitor key performance indicators, respond to trends, and maintain service quality.
   - Real-time reports support informed decision-making, helping to sustain high marketplace standards.

10. **Enhanced Notification System**

    - **Push notifications** or email updates (configurable based on user preference) ensure seamless communication.

#### System Architecture
